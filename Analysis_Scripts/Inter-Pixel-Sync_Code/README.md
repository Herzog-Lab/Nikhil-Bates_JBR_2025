# PixARv2.0 : Pixel Based Analysis of Rhythms
[Author: Nikhil | nikhil@wustl.edu]

PixAR is python based and implements pixel-based time series analysis on tif image stacks/movies by incorporating multiple analysis methods including MetaCycle, pyBOAT, FFT and Crossover analysis to analyze both stationary and non-stationary time series. 
**The user can analyse â€“**
1. 	Rhythm stability and tissue dynamics using Center of mass and its trajectory over time.
2.	Periods based on 10 different methods and phase markers.
3.	Phases based on 7 different methods and phase markers.
4.	Amplitude based on 3 different methods.
5.	Instantaneous period, phase, and amplitudes for nonstationary time series using wavelet and crossover analysis.
6.	Phase clustering and phase coherence.
7.	Phase evolution and phase-wave propagation.
8.	And visualize data in different ways including phase, period and amplitude maps, clustermaps, histograms, correlation plots and 2d scatter and polar/circular phase evolution plots.  

## Installation and Usage:
1. Installaton details and User Manual can be found in 'Read_Me/PixAR User Manual'
2. There are also video tutorials and some tips about analysis in the lab YouTube page.
