PixARv2.0 : Pixel Based Analysis of Rhythms
[Author: Nikhil | nikhil@wustl.edu]

PixAR is python based and implements pixel-based time series analysis on tif image stacks/movies by incorporating multiple analysis methods including MetaCycle, pyBOAT, FFT and Crossover analysis to analyze both stationary and non-stationary time series. The user can analyse –

Rhythm stability and tissue dynamics using Center of mass and its trajectory over time.
Periods based on 10 different methods and phase markers.
Phases based on 7 different methods and phase markers.
Amplitude based on 3 different methods.
Instantaneous period, phase, and amplitudes for nonstationary time series using wavelet and crossover analysis.
Phase clustering and phase coherence.
Phase evolution and phase-wave propagation.
And visualize data in different ways including phase, period and amplitude maps, clustermaps, histograms, correlation plots and 2d scatter and polar/circular phase evolution plots.
Installation and Usage:
Installaton details and User Manual can be found in 'Read_Me/PixAR User Manual'
There are also video tutorials and some tips about analysis in the lab YouTube page.
